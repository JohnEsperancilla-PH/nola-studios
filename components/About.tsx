          back when creating content was just something we did for fun — late
          nights editing videos, designing logos for friends, running passion
          projects on the side — we didn&apos;t know it would turn into this.
          but word got around, one project led to another, and before we knew
          it, nola studios was born.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          now, we&apos;re a full-blown creative studio based in the philippines,
          working with brands that want more than just &quot;pretty
          visuals.&quot; we help businesses find their voice, build their
          identity, and grow with purpose — all while keeping the heart and
          hustle that started it all.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          we&apos;re creatives, strategists, storytellers, and problem-solvers. but
          most of all, we&apos;re people who love helping others bring their ideas to
          life — and make waves while doing it. if you&apos;ve got a vision, we&apos;ve
          got the skills (and the caffeine) to bring it to life.
